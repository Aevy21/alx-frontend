# HTML Concepts Summary

This README provides a summary of HTML concepts demonstrated in a series of interactions with an HTML document.

## 1. Document Structure

HTML documents begin with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration followed by the `<html>` element containing the document's content.

## 2. Document Metadata

Metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, page title, and description are specified within the `<head>` section using `<meta>` tags. Favicon links are also included for defining the website's icon.

## 3. Document Structure

The document structure consists of a `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` section.

### Header

- The `<header>` section typically contains navigation links and the website logo.
- In our example, the Techium logo is wrapped in an anchor tag (`<a>`) linking to the root of the folder.

### Main

- The `<main>` section holds the primary content of the webpage.
- It's divided into `<section>` elements, each representing a distinct part of the webpage's content.

### Footer

- The `<footer>` section contains information such as copyright notices, contact details, or links to related pages.

## 4. Semantic Elements

Semantic HTML elements are used to give meaning to the content, aiding accessibility and SEO.

- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) structure the content hierarchy.
- Paragraphs (`<p>`) define text content.
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) organize items in ordered or unordered lists.

## 5. Links and Navigation

Links (`<a>`) are used to navigate between pages or sections within a page. Navigation menus are typically organized within a `<nav>` element.

## 6. Wrapping Content

Content can be wrapped in `<div>` or `<header>` tags for organization and styling purposes. Wrapping content improves readability and facilitates applying styles.

## 7. Line Breaks and Comments

Line breaks (`<br>`) are used to insert line breaks within text content. Comments (`<!-- -->`) are used to add annotations or descriptions within the HTML code for clarity and documentation.
